## Ideas we want to work on
We want to predict the solar energy measured by the Short Wave Infrared Radiation (SWIR) sensor by using the more frequently measured solar energy from the Visual and Near Infrared Radiation (VNIR) sensor.
## Types of Data we will Need
Measurements from both SWIR and the VNIR sensors
## Types of Analysis/Algorithms we might use
Regression 

Pattern Analysis

Machine learning (?)
